# react-basic-hooks (muratg fork)

This is an experimental fork to make integration with `create-react-app` and `TypeScript` easier.

## About

This is an experimental implementation of React hooks on [react-basic](https://github.com/lumihq/purescript-react-basic).

*Warning:* This API relies on recent React versions (>= 16.8.0).
For more info on hooks, see [React's documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

I recommend using PureScript's new "qualified do" syntax while using this library (it's used in the examples, the `React.do` bits).
It became available in the  `0.12.2` compiler release.

This library provides the `React.Basic.Hooks` module, which can completely replace the `React.Basic` module.
It borrows a few types from the current `React.Basic` module like `ReactComponent` and `JSX` to make it easy to use both versions in the same project.
If we prefer this API over the existing react-basic API, we may eventually replace `React.Basic` with this implementation.

## Example

```purs
mkCounter :: CreateComponent {}
mkCounter = do
  component "Counter" \props -> React.do
    counter /\ setCounter <- useState 0

    React.pure $ R.button
      { onClick: handler_ $ setCounter (_ + 1)
      , children: [ R.text $ "Increment: " <> show counter ]
      }
```

More examples:

- [Counter with an effect](./examples/counter/src/Counter.purs)
- [Reducer/action-style](./examples/reducer/src/Reducer.purs)
- [Controlled inputs](./examples/controlled-input/src/ControlledInput.purs)
- Components: [Parent](./examples/component/src/Container.purs) and [Child](./examples/component/src/ToggleButton.purs)
- [Refs to DOM nodes](./examples/refs/src/Refs.purs) (and extracting hook logic from a component for reuse)
- [A Todo App](./examples/todo-app/src/TodoApp.purs) (components, inputs, state)

*A note on Refs:* The `Ref` type is useful for all kinds of state (anything which shouldn't trigger a render when changed), particularly references to DOM nodes as in the example.
Unfortunately, while this module remains a small extension to the existing react-basic library it won't be possible to pass a `ref` prop to the native DOM components from `React.Basic.DOM`.
In the meantime, use `element (unsafeCreateDOMComponent "div") { ref: elementRef }`.
